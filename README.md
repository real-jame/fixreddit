# **FixReddit** - Embed Reddit videos on Discord

This project is heavily inspired and adapted from [dangeredwolf's FixTweet](https://github.com/FixTweet/FixTweet), which in turn was inspired from the original project, [Robin Universe's TwitFix](https://github.com/robinuniverse/TwitFix). Without those, this wouldn't have been possible. Thank you both for providing such great services!!!

## Embed Videos

This project is equivalent to the various projects that embed the raw mp4 file from a Twitter link, as the official Twitter video player is very faulty (and simply doesn't appear on mobile). FixReddit provides this service for Reddit links, as Reddit videos suffer from the same problem.

## Embed Extra Info

FixReddit also includes information about the post in the embed, such as karma, comment count, award count, the poster's username, and the post's body text (if it is a text post).
